# codex-spp philosophy

codex-spp keeps pair programming focused on learning velocity, not pure output volume.

## Principles

- Human stays in control of implementation decisions.
- Weekly ratio provides an objective pressure to keep practice human-led.
- Drive mode protects practice quality by shifting AI to coach/navigation behavior.
- Logs make learning cycles observable and reviewable over time.
